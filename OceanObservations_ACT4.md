## Step 1
We need to see if the **autonomous navigation** that we wrote for the Agent works. To do that, add to the end of the code that the Agent should reach
sensors **1** and **3**. Use the coding blocks from the `||Goals: GOALS||` tab. If done correctly, when the code is run, the Agent should make its' 
way to the two sensors. 


```ghost
Goals.reach1_OO()
Goals.reach2_OO()
Goals.reach3_OO()
Goals.reach4_OO()
```
