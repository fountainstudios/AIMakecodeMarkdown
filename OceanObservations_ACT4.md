# Activity 3 â€“ Testing it out.

## Step 1
We need to see if the **autonomous navigation** that we wrote for the Agent works. To do that, add to the end of the code that the Agent should reach
sensors **1** and **3**. Use the coding blocks from the toolbox. If done correctly, when the code is run, the Agent should make its' 
way to the two sensors. You can put on a virtual headset using the button, this is programmed with the same data that we collected. By doing this you will
be able to see where the Agent is going a lot easier.
