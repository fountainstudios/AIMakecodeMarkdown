## Step 1
We are in the middle of a savannah studying the movement patterns of ocelots. 
We want to use AI to help us in this endeavor, which would greatly aid the conservation efforts directed towards these animals. 
We first need to make a photographic dataset of the ocelots as each specimen has a unique coat pattern. The will then be able to track each ocelot 
using the data that we have and the new data comming in from all over the savannah. 
Use the map, from the chest on the back of the jeep, to find the different trap cameras. Then use each camera to photograph a ocelot by pressing the button 
next to it. **No coding is required for this Activity. **
