# Activity 3 â€“ Pollutants here, pollutants there.

## Step 1
We now need to code the AI that is going to find the sources of pollution. To do that we need to **analyze** the **historical** dataset that we 
coded in the last Activity and find the locations where the concentration of pollutants is strongest.

## Step 2
First use a `||AI: supervised machine learning||` coding block and place a `||Datasets: input datasets||` coding block inside, set to **hitorical**.

## Step 3
Then place a `||AI: analyze water data||` coding block. Followed by a `||Output: locate pollution sources||` coding block. 
Now when you run the code the AI will find the locations where the pollution in the villages' drinking water is coming from.


```ghost
Datasets.input_WQ()
AI.ml_WQ(function(){})
AI.analyze_WQ()
Output.locatePollution_WQ()
