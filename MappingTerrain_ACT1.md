## Step 1
Researchers have set up an outpost in a remote and dense forest, they need to develop an AI that is going to automatically detect areas in the forest 
where illegal logging is taking place and where forest diseases are spreading. However, before that can happen data needs to be gathered about the 
forest, in the form of pictures. Talk to the helicopter pilot to fly over the forest and take some pictures of the terrain. 
Use your camera that's in your hotbar to take some pictures once you are up in the air.
**No coding is required for this activity.**
