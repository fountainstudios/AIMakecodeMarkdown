# Activity 2 â€“ Mapping everything out.

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1
In this Activity, you have to combine all of the pictures you have taken into **one** large `||datasets: dataset||`. All of this data will then be compiled and
shown as a large map of the forest. First use a `||datasets: make dataset||` coding block inside of the `||loops: start||` coding block. 

## Step 2
Place **all** of the data taken from the **three** locations inside the `||datasets: make dataset||` coding block. The data is located in the 
`||input: INPUT||` tab. 


```ghost
Input.location1PictureData_MT()
Input.location2PictureData_MT()
Input.location3PictureData_MT()
Datasets.setOfData_MT(function() {})
```
