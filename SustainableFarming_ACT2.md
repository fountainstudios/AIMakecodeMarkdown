# Activity 2 â€“ -PLACEHOLDER-

## Step 1
Now that we have placed all of the satellite beacons we need to **run** the satellite and **code** a **current** dataset from the information that 
it is sending.  

## Step 2 
First use a `||Input: control satelite||` coding block, inside of an `||loops: on start||` coding block. Inside of that place a `||Datasets: make dataset||`
coding block, and set that block to be a `||Datasets: current||` dataset.

## Step 2 
Then place all of the `||Input: location satellite data||` inside. Now when run you will be able to see the satellite camera panning over the village 
as its gathering data for the current dataset.

```ghost
Input.beacon1_SF()
Input.beacon2_SF()
Input.beacon3_SF()
Input.beacon4_SF()
Input.beacon5_SF()
Input.runSatelite_SF(datasetType.historical, function() {})
Datasets.setOfData_SF(datasetType.historical, function() {})
```
