# Activity 3 – Detecting Anomalies.

### @explicitHints true


## Step 1
In this activity you will have to use the dataset that you made inside of a machine learning algorithm. That algorithm will then have to look for 
anomalies and outline them. Start by using an `||AI: machine learning||` coding block.

## Step 2
Inside of that place an `||AI: input dataset||` coding block. After which follow that up by placing an `||AI:analyze data||` coding block.

## Step 3
As we have now imported and analyzed our data the algorithm should have a result. However, so that we can see the result on the map place an 
`||AI: place markers||` coding block.


```ghost
AI.inputMappingTerrain()
AI.analyzeMappingTerrain()
AI.placeMarkersMappingTerrain()
AI.mlMappingTerrain(function() {})
```
