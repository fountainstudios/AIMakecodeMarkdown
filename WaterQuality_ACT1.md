## Step 1
The people in the village have been getting sick, all with the same symptoms. We are suspecting that it is because of the water that everybody is 
drinking. It must be contaminated in some way. That is why we want to use AI to find the areas where the pollutants are coming from. 
However, before we can do that we need to collect water samples from the rivers around the village for a database.
Get into the boat and use the water bottles from the chest when you are on each of the locations to collect the water. 
**No coding is required for this Activity.**
